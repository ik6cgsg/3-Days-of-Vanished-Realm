# 3-Days-of-Vanished-Realm
Interactive VR game for mobile phones (Android/iOS). Full immersion in the world of quest adventures, for the age of 6+. Everyone will have to strain their brains.

# Getting Started

# Game Experience 
The game is first-person, you will:
1) Travel around the map by teleportation (without sharp jumps, so as not to turn the head).

Difficulty will grow with geometric speed. As the result, dive into the world of mysteries with pleasant music in the background.
