Interactive VR game for mobile phones, Android and iOS systems. Full immersion in the world of quest adventures, for the age of 6+. Everyone will have to strain their brains.

The game is first-person, you will:
1) Travel around the map by teleportation (without sharp jumps, so as not to turn the head).    
2) Interact with map's objects, using them to solve puzzles.    
3) Get a new level with different complexity.   

Difficulty will grow with geometric speed. As the result, dive into the world of mysteries with pleasant music in the background.

# Analogues
Currently, there are not so many analogues due to underdevelopment of the VR applications market.
But still there are a few worthy games, which ideas prompt us to implement our own.
Here is the list of such projects:

1) ["VR Прятки с Томой"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garpix.tomavr)
Beautiful app with detailed textures, BUT:
	  * We don't have any "timing" actions
	  * We implement more interesting level design
  	* We have much more comfortable UI, movement and interaction
	
2) ["Cardboard Design Lab"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.cardboard.apps.designlab)
Professional vr demo and development tutorial in one thing, BUT:
  	* It's only a demo, not a full game (can't stand our deep worked game)
  	
3) ["Virtual Virtual Reality"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TenderClaws.VVR)
2017 Google Play Award Winner for “Best VR Experience”,
Unity Awards finalist "Best VR Game", and so on, BUT:
	  * Not a cheap one (our project is open source and absolutely free!)
	  * Requires complex and expensive toolbox (we need only Cardboard) 
Other apps on current market are either poor quality or even dangerous
